## Acknowledgement and Credits

The idea to create a VSCode extension for generating the material palettes was inspired from [material-palette-generator](https://github.com/edelstone/material-palette-generator) by [Michael Edelstone](https://michaeledelstone.com/). Michael was considerate enough to have extracted the inline generator tool from within the Material docs and provide it to the world with some interface improvements. I've used his project as a base and adapted it to be used as a VSCode extension.

Credits to Google Inc. as well since the main alogorithm and a lot of the code used in this extension belongs to them. The licenses have been kept intact for the same.
